# OpenShift Management

This repo contains a set of general _good practice_ jobs that can be used as a starting point for operationalizing an OpenShift Container Platform cluster. This repo breaks down into several categories:

- *jobs* - a set of _jobs_ (including _ScheduledJob_) templates for common tasks
- *etcd-procedures* - a set of documents and playbooks to operate etcd clusters in OpenShift
